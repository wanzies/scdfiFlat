We are Team Lighting Guard, which consists of Nur Syazwan, Nur Arif and Ahmad Amran. Syazwan is from Singapore Institue of Technology
in BSC in Real-Time Interactive Simulation, Arif is from Singapore University of Social Sciences in BSC in Counselling and Amran is from
Singapore Institute of Management - University Of London in BSC Computing and Information Systems. All 3 of us are passionate about 
improving Singapore's crisis handling and that our contribution would hopefully help Singapore in a better way.

Our idea is to improve on our SCDF's reactive and reactive responses to crisis in flats by introducing a system that 
not only handles crisis, but also gathers the data required. Our technology, the iFlats system, equips flats with smart sprinklers and
motion sensors controlled from the flat's individual control room.

Getting Started:
1. Download and extract this SCDFiFlat repository
2. Click on the iFlat Systems.exe in the 
   scdfiFlat-master/scdfiFlat-master/scdfiFlat/scdfiFlat/iFlat Systems.exe
3. A console window will open for
   simulated viewing of real time
   data of a flat. 
4. Two excel files will be generated.
   (FirstReponder.csv is data for 
    first responders to flats with 
    emergencies. FlatManagerData.csv
    is for the flat manager to check
    on the well being of the flat.)

Our team intended to use IBM Cloud Functions to showcase the data in a more
presentive way for monthly report.
